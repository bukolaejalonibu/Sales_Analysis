# Sales_Performance_Analysis

Sales Performance Analysis Using ETL and SQL

### Project Overview

Sales performance analysis is vital for businesses that want to understand how their products perform across different regions, customer segments, and time periods. By analyzing sales
data, organizations can identify trends, optimize pricing strategies, and make data-driven
decisions to boost revenue.

### Project Objective

In this project, you will design an end-to-end ETL process to extract raw sales data from CSV
files, transform it by performing cleaning and aggregation, and load the cleaned data into a
PostgreSQL database. After the ETL process, you will use SQL to answer key business
questions about sales performance. This project will enhance your skills in data wrangling, ETL,
and SQL querying, giving you practical experience in analyzing data to support business
decision-making.

### Data Sources

● Products: Information on the products sold.
● Sales: Transaction records and sales data.
● Stores: Store locations and their attributes.
